		<h3>A Personal Note from Pastor Dan</h3>
		
		<p>
			When I was in High School we got a new youth pastor at our church. After my mother forced me to go to youth group four times, I eventually became interested in being a part of the youth group on my own. I was involved in Youth Ministry and eventually went to Philadelphia College of Bible for youth ministry.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I ask my self why? Why the change of heart? How did I go from working hard to stay away from church to working for the church? The answer is "greater understanding of Jesus Christ!" Thatâ€™s what Tom did: he gave me a greater understanding. I found that God was not a God of rules but a God of freedom. For years I thought that God had all these rules He wanted me to follow, and all this sin I needed to run away from, but instead He had righteousness and joy to pursue. God has done a great work in my life and my desire is to see teens fall in love with Christ, just as I have.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			God has blessed me with a wonderful wife and we have been privileged to be able to travel before the kids came along to France, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, Brazil, Aruba, and Hawaii, and have traveled all over the Continental US and Canada.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Both Tara and I have extensive mission trip experience to Haiti, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, 
			and Mexico.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			As an aside, I enjoy training to compete in triathlons, playing basketball, snowboarding, and hiking. Tara and I are also Advanced Certified in Scuba Diving.
